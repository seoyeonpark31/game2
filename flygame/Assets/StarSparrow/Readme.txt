Pink? If you import into your project and see materials in pink, simply open up the SRP folder and import the "URP_Upgrade" package if you have a Universal 3D project or import the "HDRP_Upgrade" package if you have a High Definition 3D project.

If scene lighting appears to be dark, you can go to the Window menu, Rendering, Lighting. Then from the Scene tab click on Generate lighting.

Build Your Own Spaceships
You can build your own spaceships by quickly modifying the modular examples. In addition, you can also assemble your own spaceship from scratch by moving/rotating/scaling and duplicating the modules.

Changing Colors
If you are using Universal 3D (URP) or High Definition 3D (HDRP) you will see a colorize folder once you import "URP_Upgrade" or "HDRP_Upgrade". In it you will find a colorize material that will enable you to pick your color in the editor. Provided shader graph should also be easy and straightforward to edit if needed.

Additionally, I also included the PSD file in the "Masks" subfolder inside the "Textures" folder if you want to manually adjust the textures.
